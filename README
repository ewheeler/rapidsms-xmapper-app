RapidSMS app for plotting XForm entries on a map:
   - requires XForms Builder app http://github.com/ewheeler/rapidsms-xforms-builder-app
   - uses OpenLayers
   - can specify different placemark colors for each XForm

NOTE:
   - originally used with a custom map image, so will need to be updated to use OSM tiles
